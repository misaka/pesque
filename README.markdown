Pesque
======

This package is a Perl version of the Ruby package Resque. It's goal is to provide
access to the queue from Perl, without replicating the nice front-end features
that comes with the Resque gem.

At this time there are a bunch of exploratory scripts in the misc/ directory and the
beginnings of the Pesque classes in lib/.
